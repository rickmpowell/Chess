UI CLASS LIBRARY


The UI classes are a Direct2D-based windowing environment that runs on the Windows 
operating system. It duplicates some of the same functionality that is found in
the Windows API, but does so without the overhead of a Windows HWND and without
using WndProcs.


UI CLASS

	The base class of the UI system is the UI class. A UI represents a 
	rectangular area on the screen. Any UI element can have child UIs, which 
	are completely contained within the bounds and owned by the parent UI. 
	This creates a tree of UI elements.

	DEFINING CLASSES
		
	CONSTRUCTORS and DESTRUCTORS

	POSITION

		The position of a UI element is defined by its bounding rectangle,
		relative to its owning parent, and its z-order in relationship to its 
		siblings. UI elements can be visible or not visible. If a parent
		UI is hidden, none of its child UIs will be drawn.
		
	LAYOUT

		Any UI that contains child UIs should implement a Layout system.
		The Layout code will be called automatically when UI items get
		re-positioned. 

	DRAWING
	
		Drawing is broken up into two phases: erasing, and drawing.

		coText, coBack
		pbrText, pbrBack

		Transparent UIs
		
	GRAPHICS PRIMITIVES

		There is a reasonable collection of drawing primitives available to
		a UI. 

		Rectangles
		Ellipses
		Text
		Bitmaps
		Geometries
